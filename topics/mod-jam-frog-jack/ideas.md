# Starting points

frog that can move and the tongue goes to where your mouse is, instead of tongue that can move and frog that goes to where your mouse is.

absolute clusterfuck swarm of flies.

different sizes of flies?

poison flies.

random fly patterns

scoreboard based on how long you survive 

make frog smaller

BREAKTHROUGH: You play as a deadbeat frog father and you are trying to avoid your children. you can stick out your tongue to eat them if they get too close, but don't get attached or you lose (custody)

the poison frogspawn are your stinky children they are slower and bigger but can't be eaten 

eating a child gives you points, and surviving longer gives you exponentially more points. 

kind of like asteroid but with a divorced frog father.

make assets depressing as hell if you have time to add them.

make game get more difficult the higher your score is but also make score increase by more the longer you stay alive

"more difficult" = more flies, faster flies, bigger flies, 
bigger frog?

if you don't eat any of your children you get a score bonus?
